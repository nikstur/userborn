# Changelog

## 0.5.0 (Unreleased)

- Groups that were removed from the config are now emptied (all their users are
  removed from it). This makes the behaviour consistent with the way we treat
  users. They're never removed (to avoid GID re-use) but effectively disabled.

## 0.4.0

- Group memberships in /etc/users are now forcibly unique and alphabetically
  sorted, even if they weren't sorted in the config.
- Update xcrypt to 0.3.1. Now Userborn supports 32 bit.

## 0.3.0

- Userborn now calls `libxcrypt` directly via the `xcrypt` crate instead of
  shelling out to `mkpasswd`. This enables us to not change the password hash
  when a plaintext password is provided. We now check whether the password from
  the config matches the hashed password and then re-use the salt instead of
  generating a new salt. Please note that this changes nothing about the
  security posture of Userborn. If you provide a plaintext password to
  Userborn, there is nothing Userborn can do to protect it from leaking.
- You can now configure the path to the `nologin` binary via the compile-time
  environment variable `USERBORN_NO_LOGIN_DEFAULT_PATH` and the runtime
  variable `USERBORN_NO_LOGIN_PATH`. These values are used when no explicit
  shell is provided in the user config.

## 0.2.0

- /etc/{group,passwd,shadow} are now sorted by GID/UID. This follows the
  behaviour of systemd-sysusers, update-users-groups.pl and generally what the
  shadow package does, most notably `pwck --sort`.
